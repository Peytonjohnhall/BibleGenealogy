  - A clear, readable bar graph of lifespans is shown. It is titled “Lifespans of Jesus’ Ancestors.” 
    According to the graph, based on Bible sources, the lifespans of individuals born after Noah declined exponentially. 
    Therefore, if it were the case that there was a flood of Noah, then this data trend could likely be the consequence of various pollutants.

  - All of the data was carefully implemented into the insert statements. 
  - Sources are implemented for specific citations. 
  - There is a variation between Luke 3:36 and both Genesis 11:12 and 1 Chronicles 1:18. 
    If Arphaxad begat Cainan, and if Cainan begat Salah, then it logically follows that 
    Arphaxad begat Salah. That is, according to 
    Strong's Definition of Begat: יָלַד (Strong's Hebrew # 3205) "yaw-lad'" - To bring forth. To show lineage.
  - There are two different King Jehorams. There is Jehoram son of Ahab king of Israel, and there is Jehoram son of Jehosaphat king of Judah.
  - In the English tongue, a discrepancy lies in the statements of Jehoiachin's age when he 
    began to reign being eight in 2 Chronicles 36:9 and eighteen in 2 Kings 24:8. In the Hebrew tongue, 
    eight and eighteen share the same consonant: "shem-o-neh'". As a conjunction, the word ten, pronounced "aw-sawr'" 
    in the Hebrew, is included in 2 Kings 24:8. This conjunction of "shem-o-neh'" (eight) and "aw-sawr'" (ten) in the Hebrew translates in the English to "eighteen". 
    The word "eight" has the same article in 2 Kings 24:8 and 2 Chronicles 36:9.

  - The names of Cain’s descendants (Kenites) mimic the names of Adam’s descendants.
  - No explicit lifespans are written in the Bible for individuals ranging from Judah (generation 24) to Jesse (generation 33), 
    Solomon to Joseph, and Nathan to Heli. Also, Cainan’s lifespan is not written (the Cainan at generation 13, not generation 4). 
    According to this data, it would be mathematically impossible to calculate what year someone like Adam would have been born in. 
    Therefore, regardless of Jesus Christ’s date of birth, there is an insufficient amount of data points to trace ages of 
    Genesis characters based solely on Jesus’ date of birth.
  - Joash, Amaziah, Azariah, and Jehoiakim are excluded in Matthew 1:6-16 but included in 1 Chronicles 3:10-16.
